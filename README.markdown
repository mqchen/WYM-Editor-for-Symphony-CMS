It has only been tested with Chrome and Firefox and Symphony CMS 2.0.8RC3

## How to install

- Upload archive to your extensions folder and uncompress.
- The `wmdeditor` folder should be immediately within the `extensions` folder.
- Go to Symphony → Extensions and enable "WYM Editor".
- Navigate to any section: Blueprints → Sections
- Add a field of type textarea and select WYM Editor as the text formatter

## Known limitations
