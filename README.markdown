## WYM Editor for Symphony CMS

This extension brings the WYM Editor to Symphony CMS as an extension

This is in very early development and not everything works yet. It was done out of necessity in a matter of a couple of hours, but it might get better in the future.

It has only been tested with Chrome and Firefox and Symphony CMS 2.0.8RC3
