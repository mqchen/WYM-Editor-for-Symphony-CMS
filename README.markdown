This is in very early development and not everything works yet. It was done out of necessity in a matter of a couple of hours.

It has only been tested with Chrome and Firefox and Symphony CMS 2.0.8RC3

## How to install

- Upload archive to your `extensions` folder and uncompress
- Go to Symphony -> Extensions and enable "WYM Editor"
